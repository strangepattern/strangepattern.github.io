While researching shrimps I encountered a fascinating paper titled, "Two Asian fresh water shrimp species found in a thermally polluted stream system in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany." [(PDF)](Werner Klotz, Friedrich Wilhelm Miesen, Sebastian Hüllen and Fabian Herder)

Basically, there is a huge coal power plant that warms up the river. This warmed up section of river has apparently become a dumping ground for aquarium fish including guppies and bristlenose catfish. Stranger still, the researchers discovered two species of freshwater shrimp, one of which is _Neocaridina davidi_, the Red Cherry Shrimp: "Both species established proliferating populations," the authors report. 

As the paper mentions, the Red Cherry Shrimp itself isn't a tropical species. It comes from mountain streams that, though warm in the summer, can drop to 6-8ºC in the winter. 

It's not clear to me whether or not the "proliferating population" had any of the bright red color variants like those common in the aquarium trade. The photo from the paper shows more ruddy-colored shrimp, closer to the natural coloration. It would be even more amazing if the brightly colored variations, bred for ornamental purposes in the aquarium, managed to survive in the wild despite their loss of camouflage. The report does say that the red color morph reportedly proliferated for a few seasons in an artificial pond covered with thick ice in winter.

The Red Cherry Shrimp was always one of my favorite freshwater shrimp. It's easy to breed, colorful, and looks great in a planted tank, where a colony acts as an industrious gardening crew. It's a scrappy little shrimp, and I guess I shouldn't be too surprised that it has spread outside it's natural habitat as a result of the aquarium trade. 

The shrimp is an invasive species, and could pose a threat to native species in the same ecological niche. The paper concludes with a warning: "The thermal gradient connected directly to native ecosystems might even be a prime setting for adaptation of exotic species."
